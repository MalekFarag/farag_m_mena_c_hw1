	<h2> Team member #2: <br>
	Cindy Mena</h2> <br>
	<p>Hello my name is Cindy Mena. I’m from El Salvador. I recently move to Canada and I’m loving it. 
I graduated as a graphic designer in 2011. I like to watch movies on my spread time and also going out and spend time with friends. <br>I like being outdoors enjoying the scenery of this place. And I’m so glad to be part of Ragna – the most amazing team!
